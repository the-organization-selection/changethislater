# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of our project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these guidelines to report it:

### For Critical or Severe Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a critical or severe security vulnerability that could potentially cause significant harm if exploited, please report it privately to me:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue or pull request.
2. Send an email to [support-here@thestoreselection.com](mailto:support-here@thestoreselection.com) with details of the vulnerability.
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue if possible.
4. If you have a proposed fix, please include it in your email.

I will inform you within 48 hours and send you regular updates (if possible) about the progress. If you don't get a response, please follow up via email to ensure I received your original message.

If it happens to be the same code as the original code of the team's site, you should report them privately too. Otherwise, I will report it.

### For Minor Vulnerabilities

For minor security issues that you believe won't cause significant problems:

1. You can create a GitHub issue with the label "security" or submit a pull request.
2. Please provide a clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
3. If submitting a pull request, ensure your fix doesn't introduce new security issues.

## What to Expect

- I will confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report as quickly as possible and keep you informed about the progress.
- I will validate the vulnerability and determine its impact.
- I will release a fix as soon as possible, depending on the complexity of the issue.

## Disclosure Policy

- I aim to disclose the issue publicly once a mitigation or fix is available, typically within 90 days of the initial report.

## Out of Scope

The following are not considered vulnerabilities and should not be reported:


- Vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not directly related to this project.
- Vulnerabilities that require physical access to a user's device.
- Social engineering attacks.

## this may change so keep looking at this regularly :>

Thank you for helping! ğŸ˜„
